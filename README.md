**An end-to-end, containerised web platform for calculating material stress-strain curves from high-speed impact footage and sensor data.** 🔬

---

## Overview

StrainVisor is a complete data analysis platform designed to automate materials science research. It processes raw data from drop-weight impact tests—consisting of high-speed `.cine` video and `.csv` force-time data—to generate synchronised, accurate stress-strain curves.

The entire application is architected using a modern microservices approach and is fully containerised with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

### System Architecture

The platform is divided into three independent, communicating services:



1.  **Dash Frontend:** A user-friendly web interface for uploading experimental data, triggering analysis pipelines, and visualizing the final stress-strain curve.
2.  **Data Analysis API:** A Python backend service (built with Flask/FastAPI) responsible for parsing, cleaning, and processing time-series force data from sensor logs.
3.  **Video Analysis & Sync API:** The core computer vision engine. This powerful Python service implements advanced algorithms to analyze high-speed video, track material deformation, and synchronize the visual data with the force data to produce the final analytical result.

## Core Technology & Features

### Features

* **Multi-Modal Data Ingestion:** Seamlessly upload and process high-speed video and corresponding time-series sensor data.
* **Automated Impact Detection:** Intelligently identifies the precise frame of impact by synchronising video contours with force-transducer signal events.
* **Advanced Image Segmentation:** Uses a robust **Watershed Algorithm** pipeline to isolate and track the deforming sample, even after contact with the impactor.
* **Time-Series Synchronisation:** Accurately aligns the strain data (derived from video) with the stress data (derived from sensors) to create a unified dataset.
* **Interactive Visualisation:** Renders the final stress-strain curve in the web UI for immediate analysis.

### Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Dash, Plotly, Python
* **Backend APIs:** Python, FastAPI
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
* **Numerical & Signal Processing:** NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels, Pandas
* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
